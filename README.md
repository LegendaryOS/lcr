# ZCR - Zenit Community Repository

# Creating your own repo
In your GitHub repo, create a directory called /zcr-build-files/ and add two scripts there: one that will unpack, for example, the .desktop file in /usr/share/applications and scripts, etc., and the second file, remove.sh. This file removes files unpacked using unpack.sh. To submit your own repo to zcr, visit https://github.com/Zenit-Linux/zcr/issues or https://github.com/Zenit-Linux/zcr/discussions and write to us.
